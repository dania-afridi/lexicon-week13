        <h2>What is pâtisserie?</h2>
        <p>
            Pâtisserie is used to describe French pastries and the pastry shop they 
            are sold in. Although the word is used quite liberally in English-speaking 
            countries, in France and Belgium the law restricts its use to bakeries who 
            employ licensed maître pâtissier (master pastry chefs).

        <h2>Specialty Coffee</h2>
        <p>
            We proudly serve Caffe Vita’s delicious coffee blends and single origins. 
            They are pioneers in the Farm Direct movement where coffees are sourced 
            directly from farmers that are committed to sustainable practices. All 
            coffees are roasted to order and delivered weekly by our Brooklyn based 
            roaster.
